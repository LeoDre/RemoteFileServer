Many people have multiple identities. For example, some men in Japan love to dress like girls because they have both male and female identities. Sometimes they feel like they are men and other times they feel like they are girls. The high working pressure and high expectations for men in Japan make these men have multiple identities. When they are males, they need to face the pressure; when they switch to their female identity, they can release their pressure and show their vulnerabilities. Susan Faludi describes a similar but different situation in her essay ¡°The Naked Citadel¡±. The Citadel is an all-male school and therefore, cadets in The Citadel can comfortably express their identities. They don¡¯t need to be what the real world wants them to be. They can be vulnerable and they can show their flaws in The Citadel. Therefore, The Citadel becomes a place where cadets can dissociate themselves from the real world and be what they should be or what they want to be. Different from these cadets¡¯ conscious dissociation, Martha Stout shows how unconscious dissociation affect people¡¯s identities in her essay ¡°When I Work Up Tuesday Morning It Was Friday¡±. She explains how dissociation make people forget about their traumatic memories and therefore changes their identities. People who dissociate from the reality because of their traumatic memories changes their identities unconsciously. However, Leslie Bell introduced a conscious way of changing identities called ¡°split¡± in her essay ¡°Selection form Hard to Get: Twenty-Something Women and the Paradox of Sexual Freedom¡±. People split when they feel pressure or anxious. They choose another identities to get rid of their anxious or confuse. The Citadel offers cadets a shelter that cadets can choose their own identities and stay away from the pressures and expectations of the society. The cadets are willing to dissociate from the real world outside The Citadel because The Citadel provides them with a more comfortable mental space. This comfortable and secure mental space allows the cadets to express their desires comfortably so that they can eliminate their pressures and anxiety. However, the cadets don¡¯t realize that they can¡¯t split without paying a price. They have to go back to the real world and switch back to the ¡°man¡± they used to be.  
Dissociation helps the cadets create a safe mental space at The Citadel. Dissociation offers people a more comfortable or a more ideal mental space so that people are more willing to dissociate from the reality rather than stay in the reality. For trauma victims who dissociate, dissociation enable them to mentally escape from a traumatic event or memories of that event. For example, in Stout¡¯s essay, Julia dissociates when she was abused. This is because when she dissociates, she can¡¯t feel pain and gradually ¡°her mind had learned how to dissociate Julia¡¯s self from what was going on around her, how to transport her awareness to a place far enough away that, at most, she felt she was watching the life of a little girl named Julia from a very great distance¡± (Stout 426). Julia¡¯s brain protects her from being mentally present when she is beaten. Her brain allows her to imagine that she is not there. Since when Julia dissociates she can distance herself from the actual pain she is suffering, she feels like she is separate from her body; she is dissociated from reality and so dissociation can protect her from feeling pain and provides her with a safe mental space. However, dissociation is threatening to ruin Julia¡¯s life. She has lost her childhood memories because of dissociation and her lost memories make her feel confused about her identity. Dissociation indeed provides people a sense of safety and the ability to disconnect from reality; however, they cannot escape from reality forever. People still need to face reality after they dissociate. For example, Julia will have to experience psychological pain once she faces memories of her original trauma or she will lose her ability to know the truth about her past because of her confusion of her identity. The Cadets choose to enter The Citadel to dissociate themselves from the real world. This is because The Citadel can provide a safe space for them to feel more comfortable expressing emotions and demonstrating behaviors that would be considered ¡°unmanly¡± in the real world. The Citadel is a ¡°male paradise¡± for the cadets because it allows them to dissociate from the real world and from the pressures that men need to face and expectations that men are expected to meet in the real world outside The Citadel. The Cadets are able to feel safe and secure in the all-male environment of The Citadel. A good example will be the male bathroom. One of the cadets states that ¡°I know it sounds trivial, but all of us in one shower, it¡¯s like we are all one, we are all the same, and-I don¡¯t know- you feel like you¡¯re exposed, but you feel safe. You know these guys are going to be your friends for life ¡­ I just can¡¯t explain it but when they take that away this place will be ruined¡± (Faludi 75).  The Cadets don¡¯t need to worry about their social positions and their achievements in The Citadel. They are all the same in The Citadel. Therefore, they feel like The Citadel provides them with a safe environment. However, after a few years, when they graduate from The Citadel, they still need to face the problems, the pressure that society provides them. Even worse, they will feel uncomfortable and unsafe when they suddenly exit The Citadel. The Citadel can ensure that the cadets feel safe inside The Citadel. But when they leave The Citadel they still need to learn how to be strong and how to face pressure. Dissociation is not forever, even though it provides Julia with a temporary comfortable mental place and provides the cadets with a temporary ¡°men paradise¡±. Julia needs to face her confusion about her identity when she stops dissociating and the cadets need to face their pressures when they graduated from The Citadel. Therefore, dissociation offers people a limited time of peaceful and comfortable mental place. People need to use this period of time to eliminate their pressures, anxiety or confusions and then, prepared to face the real world problems.     
	Dissociation from the real world out The Citadel helps cadets more comfortably express their desires; therefore, this reduces the cadets¡¯ anxieties and confusion. Trauma victims involuntarily dissociate when memories of their past trauma are triggered, causing their minds to be disconnected from reality. Stout describes one of her patients, Julia, in her essay. In therapy with Stout Julia discovers that she dissociates from reality when she was abused as a child. Dissociation allowed Julia to feel no pain when she was abused. Julia¡¯s brain shuts down all her feeling ¡°sensors¡± which made escape the pain of her traumatic experience. Therefore, Julia¡¯s ¡®self¡¯ departed from reality when she went into a dissociate state. However, as an adult, Julia continues to go into dissociated states which makes Julia feel confused about her identity. Julia tells Stout ¡°if that¡¯s what I am doing, then it¡¯s the illusion from the hell. I mean, if it¡¯s supposed to safe me, it¡¯s not working. In fact, it¡¯s going to kill me one day¡± (Stout 437). Dissociation causes Julia to not remember her memories of her original trauma. She also has no control over her episodes of dissociation, which is frightening to her. Julia realizes that dissociation is not helping her; rather, it is an ¡°illusion from hell¡± that makes it impossible to know the truth about her past and the truth who she is. The more Julia wants to know about her past trauma, the more confused she will feel about her identity.  Furthermore, this confusion makes Julia feel anxious and her mental anguish her want to commit suicide several times. Dissociation originally helped Julia to escape from physical and psychological pain when she was abused, but she suffers from much more mental pain now that she older. Julia has lost access to her traumatic memories because of dissociation and therefore she feels she has lost her identity, which made her feel anxious and terrified. In contrast to Julia¡¯s case, dissociation helps the cadets at The Citadel achieve their desires and eliminate their anxieties. The Citadel provides the cadets with ¡°an escape hatch from the social burdens of traditional masculinity¡± (Faludi, 102). The real world outside The Citadel expects men to ¡°be strong¡±, be muscular and to take on many responsibilities. However, not every man wants to fulfill these expectations all the times. They also need time and a space where they can show their flaws, their vulnerabilities, and a time when they can be released from pressures. The Citadel is different from the real world because there are no women in The Citadel. When a man shows his vulnerabilities to a woman, she will think he is ¡°soft¡± and ¡°weak¡±. However, when he shows these characteristic to other men, other men will think that is normal. This is because men feel they must successfully project and display a strong masculine image in the present of women. So, men in the real world are pressured to choose this traditional masculine identity, a real ¡°man¡± identity that prevent them comfortably expressing their ¡°human¡± side. However, at The Citadel, ¡°you don¡¯t have to be a breadwinner. You don¡¯t have to be a leader. You can play back seat. It¡¯s a great relief. You can act like a human being and not have to act like a man¡± (Faludi 102). The Cadets can choose their own identities at The Citadel; they can be themselves. When they don¡¯t have to act like ¡°real men¡±, their pressures are eliminated. The Citadel offers the cadets opportunity to dissociate from the real world. The cadets don¡¯t need to worry whether they are ¡°strong¡± enough. They can be who they meant to be. The cadets¡¯ dissociation eliminates their pressures and concerns. They enjoy their dissociation from the real world outside The Citadel. However, Julia has to face her confusion and anxiety which is caused by dissociation. People dissociate to escape from the world they dislike, but they also need to pay for their dissociation; just like splitting. They also need to consider what will happen after they dissociate.
	The Citadel seems to provide the cadets with a paradise, but it actually makes it more difficult for the cadets to face the real world due to splitting; because they don¡¯t know that the one who make them worried and afraid is always themselves. The cadets feel pressures from and anxiety about in the real world outside The Citadel. This is because they are expected to have muscular identities. They feel that in the world outside The Citadel they can¡¯t show they weakness and vulnerability whenever they want and this makes cadets have no chance to release their pressures. Therefore, when they enter The Citadel, they split; they become normal people who can show their weakness and vulnerability. The Citadel is an all-male school, so the cadets don¡¯t need to worry about always being masculine and they can escape from the pressures which they feel are burdensome at The Citadel. In order to maintain this situation, the cadets ¡°must defend their inner humanity with outer brutality may say as much about the world outside The Citadel walls as about the world within them. The cadets feel called to defend those walls. Never mind that their true idea may not be the vaunted one of martial masculinity, just as their true enemy is not Shannon Faulkner¡± (Faludi 103). The cadets cannot stay in The Citadel forever. After they graduate, they can¡¯t split anymore; they need to face the real world again. The pressures and the anxiety will all come back to their lives. If The Citadel is a paradise and an utopian world for the cadets, why they can¡¯t stay in their utopia world forever and not have to go back to the real world outside The Citadel. This is because the cadets treat The Citadel in the wrong way. The cadets¡¯ real enemy is not Shannon Faulkner nor all other women. Their real enemy is themselves. It is themselves who are not strong enough to face the real world and face society; it is themselves who choose to split at The Citadel; it is themselves who choose to be weak and vulnerable. The Citadel indeed is the paradise for males, but in a different way. The Citadel is the place where trains the cadets to be muscular and strong and prepares them to face the real world outside The Citadel. Therefore, the cadets are not meant to split in The Citadel. This is because splitting will just make it more difficult for them to face the world outside The Citadel. They need to worry more about their splitting instead of worrying about women who can ¡°destroy¡± their paradise. For the ¡°twenty-something women¡± (Bell 25), Bell observes that they also face confusion, pressures and anxiety just like the cadets. Splitting helps the women ensure what kind of people they want to be. However, women need to pay a price for their splitting just like the cadets need to worry about their lives after they graduate from The Citadel. Women nowadays are confused about their identities and they feel anxious about choosing an identity. Therefore, they split. Women split ¡°not because they were in any way pathological, but because of the unsettled nature of this new in-between period of early adulthood for women, and the uncertainty and anxiety that accompany it¡± (Bell 29). Twenty-something women suffer from the ¡°paradox of sexual freedom¡±. They want to be a ¡°good girl¡±, but may also pursue their sexual identity. Therefore, they are confused and don¡¯t know which identity to choose. This kind of uncertainty makes them feel anxious. To deal with this kind of anxious, women split. Women split to choose what kind of people they want to be; however, they also lose other choices of identities which they may also pursue. Women pay a price to split. Women can split multiple times, but finally they will find a relativity suitable identity for themselves. It is not a prefect identity because women can¡¯t be a ¡°good girl¡± and a ¡°bad girl¡± at the same time. However, they can choose the identities that they like more. Just like some women think sex is more important than a relation, then the ¡°bad girl¡± identity is more suitable for them. Women need to pay a price to split; the cadets also need to pay for their splitting at The Citadel. The only difference is that the cadets don¡¯t realize that they need to pay for their splitting. The cadets have to face the real-world expectations after they graduate from the Citadel. Therefore, their splitting at The Citadel is not forever. The cadets need to focus more on how to face the pressures and meet the expectations in the real world rather than enjoy their life at The Citadel. There is no prefect identity for a person. People need to learn to gain and let go. Therefore, they can find the identities that are more suitable for them. 
	People always want easy and comfortable life, just like the cadets. No one likes pressures, pains, confusions, anxieties, or failures. However, all these can help people to reach success. People can learn a lot from failures and pressures. Moreover, don¡¯t immerse oneself in one¡¯s success. This is because success is temporary and only pain is forever. Success will not lead one to one¡¯s next success. Only when people face their failures and feel their pains, they can make progress. Therefore, when people fail to do something or have difficulty, don¡¯t be afraid or try to avoid it; instead people need to face them, solve them and learn from them and hey, be a man.
