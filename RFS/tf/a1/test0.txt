People nowadays are addicted to smart phones. And people sometimes are so focused on their phones that they lose their awareness of their surroundings. They may ¡°fly away¡± from reality and immerse themselves in the virtual world of their phones. People don¡¯t usually ¡°fly away¡± from reality on purpose and they usually don¡¯t know or are not aware when their minds are separate from their bodies. For example, people will never know they are too focused on their phone until someone reminds them. But this is not the only type of dissociation that people can experience. There are a lot of different types of dissociation and there are also different reasons that why people sometimes dissociate from reality. Martha Stout mentioned a clinical type of dissociation that is caused by trauma in her essay ¡°When I Woke Up Tuesday Morning, It Was Friday¡±. In her essay, she explains how traumatic memories are different from normal memories that traumatic memories can make people dissociate from reality when they are reminded by something similar to their traumatic memories. Individuals will not notice as well as not remember what happened to them during their experience of dissociation. In other words, people are not always present in reality. But people do not intentionally dissociate from the reality. For most of time people stays in reality because people can¡¯t choose to go to their own mental world. Only when something that is ¡°bad¡± enough happened, people¡¯s brain will allow people to go dissociate. When people are dissociated from the reality, they will not just totally forget what happened. Instead, they will have very fuzzy memories. And these fuzzy memories are called traumatic memories. Traumatic memories are memory fragments and since they are fragments, traumatic memories may not represent the fact. So, traumatic memories will give people wrong information of their self-knowledge. People are always in the real world, but people¡¯s brains may let people not memorize bad memories which are traumatic memories. By not memorize these traumatic memories, people will feel better psychologically, but they will also have misleading self-knowledge.
	People stays in reality for most of the time because they can¡¯t choose to go dissociate from the reality. It is human nature to stay in reality. Traumatic memories don¡¯t trap people in their own world, they isolate people from the reality for a little while until people¡¯s brain believe it is safe enough to face the reality again. Julia suffered from dissociations, when she was young, she dissociated from the reality from time to time. But when she grows up, her memory is even better than others, as Stout states in her essay ¡°At a moment¡¯s notice, Julia can speak entertainingly and at length about film, music, multicultural psychology, African politics, theories of literary criticism, and any number of other subjects. Her memory for detail is beyond exceptional, and she has the storyteller¡¯s gift¡± (424). It seems like that after experiencing trauma, people will no longer stay in their own world. Because after experiencing trauma, people¡¯s brains believe people are safe and set people to their normal mode. So, for any time except when people are hurt, people stays in reality. Also, when people are hurt, they are not totally dissociated from the reality. When people are experiencing trauma, they are not ¡°trapped¡± in their own world, their brains let them thought they are dissociated from the reality. In fact, people do have memory when they are experiencing trauma. People¡¯s brains are not able to store memory normally when people experiencing trauma. But Stout points out that people¡¯s brain can still store some of the memories when experiencing trauma ¡°traumatic memories include chaotic fragments that are sealed off from modulation by subsequent experience. Such memory fragments are wordless, placeless, and eternal, and long after the original trauma has recorded into the past¡± (422). Even though traumatic memories are ¡°wordless, placeless, and eternal¡±, they are still memories from reality. People still have memory during experiencing trauma, but these memories are stored in the deepest places of people¡¯s brains. People can¡¯t remember traumatic memories as they cannot dissociate from reality when they want to. But this doesn¡¯t mean that people do not have memories of trauma. Even when people are experiencing trauma, they are still not completely dissociate from the reality. It may seem like that when people dissociate from reality, they trapped themselves in their own world. But the reality is that people are always in reality. Dissociation is not dissociated people from reality, it is just let people not too involved in the reality. It is people¡¯s brains¡¯ choice to let people dissociate instead of people¡¯s choice. Because people are always present in reality and people¡¯s brain will decide whether let people remember what happened in reality or not remember.
People¡¯s brain will ¡°trap¡± people into their own mental world when necessary, but people can¡¯t intentionally dissociate from reality. People will dissociate from reality when they are experiencing trauma. Stout describes how Julia dissociate from reality when Julia is abused ¡°By this, she meant that her mind had learned how to dissociate Julia¡¯s self from what was going on around her, how to transport her awareness to a place far enough away that, at most, she felt she was watching the life of a little girl named Julia from a very great distance¡± (426). Julia¡¯s dissociation is typically because of trauma. When people experiencing trauma or other severe hurt, in order to let people feel better, people¡¯s brains will let people dissociate from the reality. What the brain basically do is that it disconnects the connection between people¡¯s brains and people¡¯s feeling, then people will feel less painful. However, sometimes, people will not dissociate from reality when they hurt themselves. This is because the trauma is not painful enough to trigger the ¡°protection system¡± in people¡¯s brains. The ¡°protection system¡± of people¡¯s brains is triggered instead of turned on. People can¡¯t go dissociate intentionally because people live in reality. If people live in their own mental world, they should be able to travel between reality and their mental world whenever they want. But this is not the case. The reason that people can¡¯t intentionally dissociate from reality is that dissociation have negative effect on people¡¯s memory. People will not remember or will have very fuzzy memories when they are experiencing trauma. When Stout ask Julia about her childhood, Julia can¡¯t remember anything from her childhood. Because Julia was abused by her parents when she was young and she dissociate from the reality when she was beaten, just like Stout states ¡°Simply put, Julia did not remember her childhood because she was not present for it¡± (426). Traumatic memories are fragments of memories and are stored in the deepest places of people¡¯s brains. So, people believe they are ¡°trapped¡± in their own mental world when they are experiencing trauma. Because they can¡¯t feel anything during experiencing trauma and they can¡¯t remember too much about the trauma. When the time pass by, people will forget about the trauma and related memories. It is good if people don¡¯t feel pain because of dissociation. But it is also good that people can¡¯t dissociate from reality intentionally. Because dissociation will cause loss of memories. And loss of memories will lead to incorrect self-knowledge.
	 Dissociation will cause memory issues which will result in incorrect self-knowledge. While people go dissociate, their mind block all the input from outside. If the input can¡¯t go into people¡¯s mind, then the input will not be stored and there will be no memory. This is exactly why Julia does not remember her childhood, ¡°Julia¡¯s self could go ¡®somewhere else,¡¯ could be psychologically absent. Simply put, Julia did not remember her childhood because she was not present for it¡± (Stout 426). People forget about things for a lot of reasons, but for traumatic memories, people don¡¯t just totally forget about it. Traumatic memory is just fragment of memories that can hardly be recalled or pulled out from memory. Like Julia, she knows that she has a bad childhood, but she can¡¯t remember the details. It shows that she has memories about her childhood, but the memories are fuzzy. And people will not notice that their memory are fuzzy and they will believe that that is how their memory should be. The problem is, these fuzzy memories will mislead people. They will make people have incorrect self-knowledge. Julia questions herself in Stout¡¯s essay, ¡°Why should I be alive when I lose big parts of my life? I mean, really, how can you care about anything if you can¡¯t even know the truth about yourself? If you keep losing yourself?¡± (437). Dissociation can make people forget about pain, but at the same time add confusion to people¡¯s life. People start to question themselves, start to try to pull out the traumatic memories. And then they will feel that their life is not complete and they will question about their life. The reality is that they have all the good memories and the bad memories are stored and locked away. It is not necessarily true that life is not complete without traumatic memories. However, as mentioned above, traumatic memories are not totally erased, people can still recall these memories when they experience things similar to their traumatic memories. And people will try to remember and pull out their memory or they will feel their life is incomplete. So, dissociation will mislead people¡¯s self-knowledge.  
	People have already continuously evolved for thousands of years and any function of people¡¯s brain exists for a reason. So dose dissociation. Dissociation make people feel better when they are experiencing trauma by letting people believe that they are absent from the reality so that they can hardly feel any pain. But the reality is that they are still in reality, they fool themselves. Also, traumatic memories make people believe they are not present during the trauma. All of these tricks that plays by people¡¯s brain mislead people. People will have incomplete memories that make people have incorrect self-knowledge. Humans are not perfect. But by the power of technology, people can discover their weakness. Just like people can discover they have some ¡°lost¡± memories. People don¡¯t really know themselves just like they don¡¯t know others. By keeping learning, people can have a better self-knowledge and a better understanding of human species.
