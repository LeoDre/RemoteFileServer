The brain is one of the most complex organs in one¡¯s body. The brain partly explains one¡¯s identity, thoughts and personality. People try different methods like brainwashing or using force to change individuals¡¯ minds. However, all these methods cannot permanently change one¡¯s mind. People have their true, original identities which represent their personality, characteristic, and desires. They may change their identities to adapt to the situation around them. But they will never lose their desires to pursue their true identities. In Azar Nafisi¡¯s essay ¡°Selections from Reading Lolita in Tehran¡± she describes how the state policies in Iran force women to restrict their expression of their identities. The Iranian government forces women in Iran to wear chadors to cover their bodies in order to conceal their individual identities. They also censor books and films to limit the development of Iranian women¡¯s own identities. In order to avoid this censorship in Iran, Nafisi picked a group of Iranian women to come to her home, take off their chadors, read and discuss censored books so that they can develop and express their original identities. Not only Iranian women are forced to change their identities, but in American society, men are also pressured to confirmed to gender norms and uphold an ideal masculine image. In Susan Faludi¡¯s essay ¡°The Naked Citadel¡±, The Citadel is the cadets¡¯ paradise because it is an all-male school, where the cadets can comfortably express their identities. They don¡¯t need to worry about money, power, or social status at The Citadel. They can switch to their true identities. People have the ability to switch between their original identities and their secondary identities. However, switching identities can make people confuse about their identities. In Martha Stout¡¯s essay ¡°When I Woke Up Tuesday Morning, It Was Friday¡± she describes how trauma victims suffer from dissociation. Dissociation makes people feel confused about their identities because they can¡¯t distinguish which identities are their true identities when they are constantly switching between different identities. When people live in an oppressive environment which forces them to change their identities, they will hide their true selves and switch to their secondary identities, so that they won¡¯t lose their original identities. They will wait for a suitable environment that they can freely express themselves. People can create such a suitable environment by dissociating themselves from the real world. However, dissociation can also make people like trauma victims feel more confused about their true identities.
When people¡¯s true identities are not suitable for the environment they live in, they will hide their original identities and develop a secondary identity. People have different personalities, characteristics, and desires which make people have distinct identities.    However, some identities can make it easier for people to survive. Therefore, people have to adapt to these identities and hide their original identities. At The Citadel, the cadets follow a system called fourth-class system. The fourth-class system divides the cadets into ¡°upper-class¡± cadets and ¡°lower-class¡± cadets. The ¡°lower-class¡± cadets must respect ¡°upper-class¡± cadets or the ¡°upper-class¡± will use violence to ¡°teach¡± the lowerclassmen how they should behave. All the cadets follow this fourth-class system; one of the upperclassmen explain that ¡°what he did was common procedure ¨C and no different from the ¡®motivational¡¯ treatment he had received as a knob at the hands of a senior who came into his room¡± (Faludi 81). The cadets don¡¯t want to be lowerclassmen or upperclassmen; they just want to be themselves and express their own identities. However, the cadets know that if they express their true beliefs about the system that oppress them, they will face punishment. They also know that upperclassmen and lowerclassmen identities are better identities for them if they want to ¡°survive¡±. Therefore, they will hide their true identities and switch over to their secondary identities. It is not accurate to say that punishment makes cadets switch to their secondary identities, because the upperclassmen don¡¯t receive punishment if they don¡¯t switch to their secondary identities. But if they don¡¯t switch to their alternate identities, they will not be accepted by other upperclassmen. Therefore, to ¡°survive¡± in The Citadel, the cadets have to switch to their secondary identities. For the cadets, survival means a better life at The Citadel. However, Iranian women they will be sent to jail if they don¡¯t hide their true identities. At the Iranian revolution and the takeover of the country by mullahs, the Iranian government forced Iranian women to wear chadors when they are in public. The government also instituted other rules so that they can¡¯t walk with a male unless this man is her father, brother, or husband. The government used law enforcement to supervise women¡¯s outfits and behaviors. According to Nafisi
The streets of Tehran and other Iranian cities are patrolled by militia, who ride in white Toyota patrols, four gun-carrying men and women, sometimes followed by a minibus. They are called the Blood of God. They patrol the streets to make sure that women like Sanaz wear their veils properly, do not wear makeup, do not walk in public with men who are not their fathers, brothers, or husbands (295)
The Iranian government expects all Iranian women to have a similar, suitable identity; one of the ways they do is by instituting the law that women must be fully covered by their chadors. The law may seem like it only limits women¡¯s choices of outfits. However, these regulations are creating a secondary identity for the women. Iranian women used to wear whatever they wanted and whatever they liked. Their preferences show their personalities and characteristics and furthermore shows their identities. However, when they are asked to only wear chadors, they can¡¯t express their preferences and therefore their own identities. By doing this, the Iranian government wants to gradually eliminate women¡¯s true identities and force the women in Iran to have the similar identities that the government now created for them. However, the Iranian government doesn¡¯t realize that these women only treat the identity that they create for the them as a secondary identity. Iranian women still keep their own original identities. Just like the cadets, although Iranian women want to express their true identities, they have to temporarily switch to their alternative identities in order to survive under the supervision of the Iranian law enforcement. The positive side of this is that the Iranian women only need to dress like and pretend they switched to their secondary identity while the cadets need to think and behave like upperclassmen or lowerclassmen. But no matter whether it is fake or real, people will hide their original identities and switch to their secondary identities when they are forced to do so. They are not changing identities; they are just hiding and waiting for a suitable environment to express their true identities.
	When an environment is suitable, people can express their original identities. People don¡¯t easily change their true identities. They usually just hide their true identities when they are forced to switch to their alternative identities. Therefore, their original identities still exist. They just need to wait for a suitable environment to express themselves freely. Due to social pressure, men have to switch to their masculine identity. The Citadel offers the cadets with a safe and suitable environment where they can comfortably and freely express their identities and temporally escape from these norms. One of the cadets explains that ¡°I know it sounds trivial, but all of us in one shower, it¡¯s like we¡¯re all one, we¡¯re all the same, and ¨C I don¡¯t know ¨C you feel like you¡¯re exposed, but you feel safe¡± (Faludi 75). The Citadel is an all-male school which allows the cadets to dissociate from the real world outside The Citadel. In the world outside The Citadel, men need to pretend they are strong to impress women and to express power and social status. However, at The Citadel, there are no woman and this means they can stop pretending and switch back to an identity they feel comfortable with. They can show their weaknesses and vulnerability at The Citadel because the school offers them a suitable environment where they can comfortably express themselves. The Citadel creates a safe environment for the cadets by protecting the cadets from the gender norms. Nafisi¡¯s house also creates a safe environment for her students by dissociating them from the totalitarian world outside. Her students can express their true selves because of the protection of this safe environment. Nafisi describes how her students look when they take off their black robes. She describes how ¡°Splashes of color separate one from the next. Each has become distinct through the color and style of her clothes, the color and the lengths of her hair; not even the two who are still wearing their head scarves look the same¡± (280). Women¡¯s different clothes and hair represent their individual identities. Nafisi¡¯s students can express their true selves in Nafisi¡¯s house is because it offers them protection. Nafisi¡¯s house protects these girls from the government¡¯s oppressive restrictions. They don¡¯t need to worry about being caught in Nafisi¡¯s house and express their opinions and display their individuality freely. The Citadel eliminates the cadets¡¯ mental pressure by offering them with an all-male environment. Therefore, the cadets can take off their masks and express themselves comfortably in this environment. Nafisi¡¯s house gives her students a shelter where there are no patrol cars and no limitations. Even though these two environments seem different, but they all provide a suitable environment for these men and women to express their own selves freely. People¡¯s minds are not permanently changed by oppressive environments. They are waiting for the suitable environment to switch back to their original selves.
	Dissociation allows people to express themselves freely and therefore understand more about their original identities; however, for trauma victims, clinical dissociation makes them feel confused about their true identities. However, voluntary dissociation can involve creating an environment that is suitable for people to switch back to their original identities. When people express their true selves, their original identities will be enhanced. They will know themselves more clearly. In Nafisi¡¯s house, she and her students dissociate from the totalitarian world outside her home so that they can switch back to and elevate their true identities. Nafisi describes ¡°Our world in that living room with its window framing my beloved Elburz Mountains became our sanctuary, our self-contained universe, mocking the reality of black-scarved, timid faces in the city that sprawled below¡± (281). The Iranian government wants to change women¡¯s identities by forcing them to wear chadors that conceal their individuality. In order not to be brainwashed by the government, Nafisi invites some of her students to come to her house to dissociate from the totalitarian world they live in; therefore, they can express their original identities. When they are their true selves, they stimulate their original identities which therefore make them stronger. Furthermore, when they are ¡°mocking the reality of black-scarved, timid faces in the city¡±, their free, original identities contrast with the identities of the women outside her home. This makes them know more about what kind of people they want to be and thus they enhance their individual identities. Therefore, dissociation allows Nafisi and her students to switch back to their original identities and express and celebrate about their true selves. However, for trauma victims, dissociation makes them feel confused about the truth of their identities. Julia is a trauma victim who tries to retrieve part of her identity which she has not been able to access due suffering from clinical dissociation. She experiences confusion about her identity because her dissociation prevents her from accessing traumatic memories of her past. She asks Stout ¡°Why should I be alive when I lose big parts of my life? I mean, really, how can you care about anything if you can¡¯t even know the truth about yourself? If you keep losing yourself?¡± (Stout 437). Dissociation is a protective mechanism that separates people¡¯s minds and bodies when they are experiencing trauma or when memories of past trauma trigger their brains to disconnect from the reality. However, people¡¯s traumatic memories will be therefore blocked. This makes trauma victims feel confused about their true identities because they want to access their traumatic memories in order to know their true selves. But their memories of their past are repressed and unless they use therapeutic methods such as hypnotism, they can¡¯t access their lost memories. Therefore, dissociation makes trauma victims feel confused about their true identities. For people like Nafisi, dissociation provides them with a suitable environment where they can express freely their individual identities and better express themselves. However, for trauma victims like Julia, dissociation prevent them from knowing the truth about their identities. Different people have their own backgrounds; therefore, people should choose the suitable way based on their background if they want to know more and better about themselves.
	One will face various pressure throughout one¡¯s life. Some of them may be small pressure but some of them may be catastrophic. A successful person is not someone who deals with less pressure. Instead, if one knows how to handle pressure, he or she will have a greater chance to be successful. Just like Nafisi and her students, they know how to hide their true selves when they face the oppressive of their government.  They don¡¯t physically fight for their rights and freedoms, but they hide themselves and express their power in a suitable environment. People should live like a spring; when under pressure, they yield and save their power; when the pressure is gone, they use all the power they get from the pressure to switch back and it even becomes better.
