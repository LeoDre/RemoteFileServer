There is an old saying in China: ¡°Take history as a mirror¡± which basically means that leaders of a country should learn from their history and enhance their advantages and fix their disadvantages. It is also true for normal people. People use their experiences to make decisions, to make themselves better and to teach the next generation. Experiences lead to memories or are part of one¡¯s memory. People¡¯s memories have different categories and people usually assume their normal memories are the same as their experiences. However, in Martha Stout¡¯s essay ¡°When I Woke Up Tuesday Morning, It Was Friday¡± she describes a type of memory called ¡°traumatic memories¡±. Traumatic memories are fragments of memories. They cannot be remembered intentionally and they can affect people¡¯s knowledge of their identities. Because people dissociate from reality when they are experiencing trauma they later cannot remember their trauma.  Once people discovered that they have traumatic memories they will question their own identities. It is hard for people to accept that they don¡¯t know themselves very well. This will make them feel anxious. But knowing oneself too well can also make people anxious. In Leslie Bell¡¯s essay ¡°Selections from Hard to Get: Twenty-Something Women and the Paradox of Sexual Freedom¡± she describes how women choose to be sexually active or to not be sexually active. Some women usually feel confused about their identities because they don¡¯t clearly understand what they want. But no matter what they choose they will always lose other choices. Therefore, these women start to feel anxious about their choices regarding their sexuality and relationships. They feel anxious not because they don¡¯t know what they want; instead they know too well what they want. Experiences have significant impacts on people¡¯s identities and experiences affect people¡¯s identities differently based on people¡¯s different understandings of their own experiences. But when people don¡¯t fully understand their experiences, they may also lose their identities.
	Experiences will make people understand themselves better, and therefore shape their futures. Experience or memories are tools that people evaluate themselves. People usually do things based on their experiences, especially their earlier experiences. Bell described how Jayanthi¡¯s first experience of sex affects Jayanthi¡¯s decision. Bell observers ¡°It turned out, however, that Jayanthi had greater expectations of a relationship than the man did. She later felt the man had ¡®played¡¯ her ¨C he was dating other women, and she was disgusted and put off by that.¡± (32). Jayanthi felt that she was played by her first boyfriend. Therefore, she decides not to be played again. But what if her boyfriend is a prefect ¡°Mr. right¡± for her; will she still decide to be ¡°either played or too involved¡±? Definitely no; she will have another love story. Experiences change people¡¯s identities. More specifically, people¡¯s own experiences change people¡¯s identities. People will question others¡¯ experiences, but they will never doubt their own experience. From good experiences, people will learn how this good experience happened and try to let it happen again. This is because people enjoy good experiences. From bad experiences, people will learn how to avoid having this kind of experiences again. But in contrast to learning experience from others, people will not consider right or wrong before they learn from their own experience. This is the case for Jayanthi; she indeed could avoid being played by learning from her past experience, but there is better way for her to find sex and love. When people believe in themselves, once they find out the way to achieve success, they will try to repeat an experience to achieve more success. By continuing to learn from oneself, people will gradually develop their own ways to deal with things. Their own ways of doing things will help them develop their own identities. When people don¡¯t have memories of important experiences in the past, they will not develop certain identities. When Stout describes Julia¡¯s memory, she observes ¡°that was all she remembered of her childhood, this successful thirty-two-year-old woman with the cinematic mind. And it took forty-five minutes for her to pull out that much from the dark, silent place that housed her early memories¡± (425). Julia almost has no memory of her childhood because she was dissociated from reality when she was abused. Since she doesn¡¯t have any memory of this abuse, her identity is not affected by her ¡°abused experience¡±. So, people can¡¯t affect by experience that they do not remember because people need to understand their experiences in order to learn from their experiences. If people do not understand their experiences, they will not learn from their experiences.  
	People will feel confused about their identities when they don¡¯t fully understand their experiences. Experiences can indeed affect people¡¯s futures, but experiences are not clear commands which tell people what to do in their future step by step. People need to analyze and evaluate their experiences in order to learn from them. However,  sometimes people may feel confused about their experiences and this will lead to misunderstanding of their experiences.  For example, when Jayanthi knows that she was ¡°played¡± by her first boyfriend, she doesn¡¯t know how to evaluate this experience. Bell describes Jayanthi¡¯s confusion like so based on her previous experience with men. Bell observed ¡°In that first experience, she felt devastated and too emotionally involved. She vowed not to be played by a man again. So, to avoid being either played or too involved, Jayanthi spent the next decade bouncing back and forth between being good and being bad¡± (32). Jayanthi wants to have sex but she doesn¡¯t know how to not be played while having a relationship or sex. She can¡¯t evaluate what strategies she needs to use from her experiences. People can often learn from their experiences, but sometimes what they learn from their experiences is not what they want. The conflict between what they want and what their experiences tell them to do makes people feel confused. This confusion will make people also feel confused about their identities. They don¡¯t know want kind of people they should be, just like Jayanthi who ¡°spent the next decade bouncing back and forth between being good and being bad¡± (32). Not only do ambiguous experiences make people confused, but missing memories can also make people feel confused about their experiences, and therefore, their identities. Traumatic memories make people feel confused about their lives. Julia tells Stout about how her traumatic memories affect her lives. Julia claims ¡°I know I¡¯ve tried to kill myself intentionally, more than once, so maybe this sound crazy-but I don¡¯t want to die one day just because I am confused¡± (437). People who have traumatic memories know they have some missing memories. But they don¡¯t know what memories they have missed. Trauma victims will start to question themselves; they will doubt whether their experiences are reliable. Furthermore, they will lose confidence in themselves because they think they don¡¯t fully understand their experiences and they don¡¯t fully understand themselves. They may try to commit suicide just like Julia did because they feel confused about their identities and because psychological torment. They think their bodies and minds are disconnected. When people can¡¯t understand their experiences, they will feel confused about them. This confusion will make people feel that they don¡¯t know what kind of people they should be. Only by discovering new meaning of their experience they can eliminate their confusion about their identities.
When people have a new understanding of their experiences, their identities will change. People do not always fully understand their memories or they don¡¯t remember all of them. When people realize that their experiences may be different than they thought, they will try to find out the true meaning of their experiences. For example, trauma victims like Julia, have incomplete experiences due to their traumatic histories. But for Julia, she doesn¡¯t want to leave those traumatic memories alone. She wants to remember all those traumatic memories, in order to eliminate her confusion about her identity. Therefore, when Stout asks her ¡°Why do you have to?¡± (437).  Julia replies ¡°Because I want to know. Because I want to live¡± (437). Julia felt confused about her identity before because she didn¡¯t have a full understanding of her past experience of trauma. As Stout states ¡°I believe that Julia might be ready to bring up the lights in the cold, dark house of her past¡± (437). After Julia remembers her traumatic memories, she will hopefully have a better life. This is because, now, Julia will fully understand her experience and she will no longer feel confused about her memories or her identity. By remembering one¡¯s missing memories, a person can know oneself better and have a better understanding of one¡¯s past experience. Furthermore, people will experience less confusion about their identities and feel more confident when they have a better understanding of their experiences. For a lot of people, they may not have traumatic memories or missing memories, but they may still have confusion about their past experiences. When they have a new understanding of their experiences or they realize the meaning of their experiences, they will better know themselves and they will know better about what kind of people they should be. Jayanthi used to be really sexually active, but after she was sexually abused by four men, she has a new understanding of her experience. Bell describes how ¡°After this experience, Jayanthi¡¯s strategy shift from being a bad girl who was ¡®up for anything¡¯ to being a bad girl who was in control¡± (36). Jayanthi is a woman who wants to have ¡°a history that differed from her family¡¯s expectations¡± (Bell 37). She wants to be really crazy about sex. But now, after she was abused by 4 men, she finds out that she was too cray about sex and too involved into sex and relationships. She was freak out when she was abused by four men and she also found out that she was played by her sexual partners.   And what she need to learn from her previous sexual experiences is that she should not played by men. Her identity changed after she finds out the new meaning of her experiences. By experiencing more, people will have more experiences and every time when a new experience is added to people¡¯s lives, they will have a different understanding of their old experiences. This is because new experiences are integrated into all existing experiences and this integration can make people understand their memories differently. This is just like the look of a puzzle which may be totally different by just adding a few more puzzle pieces. When people have a new understanding of their experiences, they will learn from their new understandings. Their identities will change because now their behaviors, personalities and habits are all based on their new understandings of their experiences.
People want to learn from their past experiences because they want to make sure that they don¡¯t make same mistakes, they want to find the way to the success and they want to know more about themselves. People will also have different understandings of their experiences as they grow up. That¡¯s why people¡¯s identities keep changing when they are growing up. But people should not choose their identities only based on their past experiences. People need to have the courage to try new experiences. Only in that way people can accumulate more and more experiences and people will have more choices when they try to make decisions based on their experiences. An experienced person is not someone who has a lot of same experiences but someone who has experienced a lot of things. Therefore, people need to not only look back at the history, but also look forward at the futures, in order to become experienced and to have colorful lives.
