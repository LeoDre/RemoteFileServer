People nowadays care more and more about environments around them. They not only care about nature environment but also care about environments like living environments, study environments and working environments. Environments can affect people¡¯s behaviors, moods and so on. For example, no one wants to play video games or even talk loudly in Harvard Library. Harvard Library creates a great study environment which makes people want to silently study there. In Malcolm Gladwell¡¯s essay ¡°The Power of Context: Bernie Goetz and the Rise and Fall of New York City Crime¡± he argues that physical environments can dramatically affect people¡¯s behaviors and they are more powerful in determining human behaviors than people¡¯s inherent identities. Individuals¡¯ identities or personalities can be dramatically changed because of their immediate environment or situation. Gladwell discusses how the environment can be changed by little things. For example, perfume can change dating experience even though perfume does not seem that important. Small things in an environment can influence human behaviors because people are sensitive to their environments. In Susan Faludi¡¯s essay ¡°The Naked Citadel¡±, she describes how the cadets react to a possible change to their environment. The Citadel is an all-male school and a male¡¯s paradise for the cadets. Because of this all-male environment, the cadets don¡¯t need to worry about the pressures and the expectations they would face in the world outside The Citadel. Therefore, they want to maintain this environment and enjoy this environment. However, when a woman is admitted to The Citadel, they fear their all-male environment will change dramatically. The cadets fear they will lose their ¡°perfect environment¡± because of this one woman and other women who then be permitted to attend their school. Therefore, they try different ways to resist this woman and try to maintain their original environment. The environment inside The Citadel is fragile that one woman can destroy the cadets¡¯ male paradise. The environment inside The Citadel is very important for the cadets. Because of the all-male environment, the cadets can comfortably express their identities. But when this environment is taken away from the cadets they need to change their behaviors and identities. The fourth-class system creates such an environment that changes the cadets¡¯ identities and behaviors. However, not all the cadets¡¯ identities are changed because of the all-male environment inside The Citadel. Some of the cadets maintains their identities because the environment inside The Citadel doesn¡¯t match their identities.
	The cadets are sensitive to the environment inside The Citadel, because an apparently minor change in The Citadel can destroy their ¡°male paradise¡±.  Every environment is unique and every environment has its specialty; a change to an environment will make this environment loses its special atmosphere and characteristic. The Citadel is an all-male school and a male paradise. If a woman is admitted to The Citadel, the cadets will lose their all-male environment. When The Citadel¡¯s all-males environment is taken away from the cadets, one of the cadets complains that ¡°I just can¡¯t explain it but when they take that away, it¡¯s over. This place will be ruined¡± (Faludi 75). The cadets¡¯ all-males environment means a great deal to them. In this environment, the cadets don¡¯t need to worry about pressures or expectations they would face in the real world outside The Citadel and they can show their weakness and vulnerability and comfortably express their identities. They can do all of this because The Citadel is different from the world outside of it. Many men feel they must display their masculinity to the women. Men often pretend to be strong to impress women. The reason they don¡¯t need to pretend or impress at The Citadel is that there are no women present. However, if one woman enters The Citadel, then the cadets will need to put on their ¡°masks¡± again. The Citadel will be no different from the world outside The Citadel. The cadets will lose their all-male environment. The Citadel¡¯s environment will dramatically change from a male paradise to a normal place because of a single woman. A woman may not seem like a big change to The Citadel compares to the population of the male cadets. However, it is a big change to cadets if there is a woman who is admitted to The Citadel. This is because she changes the environment inside The Citadel and destroys cadets¡¯ ¡°male paradise¡±. Also, if the first woman is admitted to The Citadel, the Broken Windows Theory suggests that there will be more and more women admitted to The Citadel. As more and more women are admitted to The Citadel, the environment inside The Citadel will change more dramatically. The Broken Windows Theory describes a situation like a domino effect, when there is a first broken window and no one fixes it, and so there will be more and more broken windows in an environment. This is because people will think no one cares about these ¡°broken windows¡±. In the 1980s, during New York¡¯s serious crime epidemic ¡°relatively minor problems like graffiti, public disorder, and aggressive panhandling, they write, are the equivalent of broken windows, invitations to more serious crimes¡± (Gladwell 152). People may treat writing graffiti and aggressive panhandling as a small crime or even just a bad behavior. And since there were so many of minor crime in New York in the 1980s, the police may not have originally taken them seriously. This made criminals think that the police didn¡¯t care about these little crimes. Furthermore, this sent criminals a signal that they could outsmart the police because they were never caught. Therefore, they were more confident to do more serious crimes. The environment in New York was changed gradually from being safe to chaotic and the reason of this change was the implementation of the Broken Windows Theory. When the graffiti is removed and minor crimes are solved, the crime rate dramatically decreased. Solving minor crimes is just like fixing the first broken window. It is a signal that shows criminals that polices cares about this area and let potential criminals know that they will take a huge risk if they want to commit a crime. However, inside The Citadel, a woman is not a small change to the cadets. A woman is big problem because she destroys the cadets¡¯ male paradise. She changes the environment inside The Citadel. Compare to the Broken Windows Theory which suggest a minor problem can cause big problem, the woman at The Citadel is a big problem which can cause bigger problems. Therefore, the environment inside The Citadel is fragile that a single woman can cause the change in the environment and the change in the cadets identities.
	The cadets¡¯ identities and behaviors are changed inside The Citadel because of the environment inside The Citadel. People often believe that the thing that most people are doing is the right thing and they will follow what the most people are doing. For example, when most of the people in a room start to laugh at a joke, other people will also start to laugh even if they don¡¯t get the joke. In The Citadel, the cadets must follow the fourth-class system. The fourth-class system is based on a hierarchy. The ¡°upper-class¡± men can even use violence to teach freshmen how they should respect them and this system was implemented by abusive treatment of the freshman knobs. One of the ¡°upper-class¡± men ¡°said that what he did was common procedure-and no different from the ¡°motivational¡± treatment he had received as a knob at the hands of a senior who came into his room¡± (Faludi 81). The cadets think this system is normal because they are in an environment where everyone accept it. In this kind of circumstance, the cadets are not only cadets; their identities change. The senior cadets become the ¡°upper-class¡± students at the school and need to behave like an upper class and teach the lower class that they need to demand respect. The freshmen are the ¡°lower-class¡±; they must be obedient and try not to get in trouble with the ¡°upper-class¡± students. However, when they graduate, the cadets will lose their ¡°upper-class¡± identity because they are not influenced by the fourth-class system anymore. The cadets are fully aware that their identities are changed because of the fourth-class system. They know that they are distinguished by upper-class and lower-class because of the fourth-class system. However, in the mock prison experiment, people changed their identities unconsciously. The mock prison experiment is conducted at Stanford in the 1970s by Philip Zimbardo to simulate the environment of a prison. The ¡°guards¡± and ¡°prisoners¡± were all chosen from a sample of completely normal young men. However, only after a few days, the guards become very aggressive and started to abuse their prisoners and the prisoners started to show signs of emotional distress. The guards and the prisoners were normal people before they entered this simulation of a prison and even they couldn¡¯t believe that how much they changed. One ¡°guard¡± claimed ¡°¡¯It was completely the opposite from the way I conduct myself now,¡¯ ... ¡®I think I was positively creative in terms of my mental cruelty¡¯¡± (Gladwell 158). People all have hidden personalities, and these personalities can be triggered under certain circumstances. For example, the ¡°guards¡± in the experiment were normal and peaceful people, but in the specific situation and environment of the mock prison, they became very violent and aggressive. Violent and aggressive are ¡°guard¡¯s¡± hidden personalities and the mock prison situation triggered their hidden personalities. The environment of the mock prison didn¡¯t actually change the ¡°guards¡¯¡± identities; it just triggered their hidden personality so that they didn¡¯t notice that their behavior and characteristics have changed. However, the cadets know that their identities are changed. They know that under the influence of fourth-class system they become ¡°upper or lower-class¡± men instead of normal cadets. Therefore, the cadets¡¯ identities are affect by the circumstances and the guards¡¯ hidden personalities are triggered by the circumstances. People¡¯s behaviors and identities can be changed consciously or unconsciously by the environment they are in when the environment meets their inner desires. 
	The cadets¡¯ behaviors inside The Citadel are not only affected by the environment within The Citadel, but they are also affected by their own inner desires of expressing their true identities. An environment can play a very important role in affecting people¡¯s behaviors. However, an environment is not the only factor that can affect people¡¯s actions. People¡¯s identities, backgrounds, personalities, and characteristics can all affect people¡¯s behaviors. Bernie Goetz shot four young African American men who threatened him for money in the New York underground. The Power of Context suggests that Goetz¡¯s behavior ¡°had very little to do, in the end, with the tangled psychological pathology of Goetz, and very little as well to do with the background and poverty of the four youths who accosted him, and everything to do with the message sent by the graffiti on the walls and the disorder at the turnstiles¡± (Gladwell 157). The Broken Windows Theory would argue that the filth environment and graffiti in the subway was a sign which shows Goetz that he was in a disorderly and chaotic environment that no one cares about this environment. This kind of sign threatens him and brings his emotion to the tipping point. As a result, he pulled out his gun and shot these young men. However, the Power of Context doesn¡¯t fully explain this situation. What kind of man needs carry a gun with him in a public area and what kind of man pulls out his gun and shoots four young black men who are asking him for money. Goetz¡¯s actions were not only affected by his environment, but were also caused by his background. Goetz is a racist person and his close friend and himself were badly beaten by muggers. Also, he is an angry man because his father often raged at him when his father was drunk. His personality and experiences make him lash out at those four men in the subway. He is like a fully loaded gun. He already hates, angry at and discriminates black young men who tend to cause minor crimes. And the filth and chaotic underground environment triggered all his extreme emotions. As a result, he shot at those four young men. Therefore, if Goetz is a loaded gun, then it is the environment helps him pull the trigger. The environment doesn¡¯t decide people¡¯s behaviors; instead the environment helps people to choose from the behaviors that match their personalities. The Citadel helps the cadets choose their behaviors based on their personalities. The Citadel creates an environment where the cadets can comfortably express their identities. A lot of the cadets treat The Citadel as a ¡°male paradise¡± because ¡°you don¡¯t have to be a breadwinner. You don¡¯t have to be a leader. You can play back seat. It¡¯s a great relief. You can act like a human being and not to have to act like a man¡± (Faludi 102). The Citadel provides the cadets with a comfortable environment where they can release their pressures and show their vulnerability. A lot of the cadets shows their vulnerability not because they are affected by the environments, but because they are young insecure men who are truly vulnerable. Their inner-selves cause them to express their true emotions and vulnerability and the environment just offers them an opportunity to do so. However, not all the cadets are affected by the environment inside The Citadel. Some of the cadets still keeps their masculine identities. Just like some of the ¡°upper-class¡± cadets who use violent and aggressive behavior to force the ¡°lower-class¡± cadets to respect them. Those non-aggressive cadets pretend to be masculine before they entered The Citadel. But they are truly vulnerable. Therefore, the identity that they desired matches the environment inside The Citadel. This causes them to change their identities and behaviors. However, for the aggressive cadets, the environment inside The Citadel doesn¡¯t matches their masculine identities. Therefore, their identities will not be influenced by the environment inside The Citadel. If Goetz is a fully loaded gun, then these aggressive cadets are unloaded guns. No matter how hard environments pull on the trigger, nothing will happen; they will still be themselves. Goetz¡¯s behaviors are affected by both the environment and his personality. More accurately, the environment he was in triggered his behavior which was based on his personality. The vulnerable cadets¡¯ behavior is also triggered by the environment of The Citadel. But the aggressive cadets are not affected by the environment, since the environment inside The Citadel doesn¡¯t match their personalities. People¡¯s behaviors cannot be simply changed by an environment. Only when people¡¯s personalities have something that can be triggered, then the environment that matches these personalities can affect people¡¯s identities and behaviors.
	Actually, every environment is unique and fragile; any small change or big change in an environment can make this environment lose its uniqueness. Also, since people are sensitive to the environment, the changes of an environment can lead to change in people¡¯s behaviors and identities. However, environment doesn¡¯t dominate people¡¯s identities. People decide their identities by themselves. An environment may affect one¡¯s identities, but it can¡¯t decide one¡¯s identities. Therefore, people are controlled by themselves instead of controlled by the environment. Nowadays, there are varieties of thought, ideals, theories and opinions that can affect people¡¯s own thoughts. Some of them may be good ideals and some of them may be bad ideals, but the most important thing is that people should fight for their own ideals and thoughts. Don¡¯t lose one¡¯s identity because of the influence from the outside. Be original and be yourself; don¡¯t let other pull the trigger for you.
